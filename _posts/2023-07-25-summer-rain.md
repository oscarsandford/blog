Melancholy is a necessary thing to fill the cracks between the highs and lows of life. A long run of happiness is unsustainable, because we simply acclimate and normalize over time. If we don't take notice of things that give us simple happiness each day, it all homogenizes into drudgery.

Summer rain is refreshing.

Brings back memories too. Simple sensations of cold and wet that you learn early on, when the world is small to you. I'm happy to hold onto them; the past is as eternal as the present.
