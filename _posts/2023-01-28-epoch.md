For the longest time I've wanted to have a simple and easy site for posting whatever. I miss writing, but I don't want to hold myself to a high standard here.

GitHub pages makes it easy to host, and [Moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk), a Jekyll blog theme written by Abhinav Saxena, makes it look clean and elegant.

## Social media as tools

Instagram is my favourite of the bunch (I have used it before). Tiktok is the best engineered from the perspective of continuous content delivery. Twitter is pure comedy.

All social media platforms employ similar patterns that try to keep your attention for the longest amount of time, having, to varying degrees, the unfortunate side effect of making users waste theirs.

I wanted to make this blog detached from such things. Even a platform like Medium is not suitable. I want it to be my own thing.

I'm going to use this for posting ramblings, literary art, things I'm learning that I want to pass on, and showcases of some of my hobbies. 

Or maybe I just wanted to scratch my itch of making a blog?
