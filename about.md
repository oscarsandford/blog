![oes]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/about.jpg "Oscar Sandford")

My name is Oscar.

I am motivated to create things that solve meaningful problems or simply bring joy to people. Realizing goals that align with this dream requires learning and relearning at every turn.

My academic and industry interests include artificial intelligence (machine learning and reinforcement learning), natural language processing, software evolution, software and web development.

Besides computers, I enjoy writing, philosophy, cars, video games, and Japanese culture. I like to run, climb, and hike to refresh the mind and body in the beauty of nature.
